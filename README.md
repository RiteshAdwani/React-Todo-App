# React-Todo-App
- This is a UI for a To-do App built using React.
- The setup for creating the React app is done using Webpack.
- The UI is built using React components :  class component, stateless component and functional component with hooks.
- Here, the data is static and is being passed to the list from the `ListData.jsx` file.

## Class components
- A class component is a more featured way to define a React component. 
- It also acts like a function that receives props, but that function also considers a private internal state as additional input that controls the returned JSX.
- Class component can be created using the class keyword, and it extends the React.Component class.

## Functional components
- Functional components are just javascript functions, which contains some logic to perform certain actions. 
- These components accept the data as props and return the React element which is nothing HTML content. 
- With introduction to the React 16, writing functional components is the standard way of creating components in modern react applications.

## Hooks
- Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features.
- Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.
- There are 3 rules for hooks:
    1. Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
    2. Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
    3. Hooks cannot be conditional

## Components
**1. App**
- `App` the main component that is rendered when the site is loaded.

**2. Card**
- `Card` is the main container that is the body of the todo list.

**3. CardHeader**
- `CardHeader` contains the the details regarding date, time and the day.

**4. TaskList**
- `TaskList` contains the list of tasks and the checkbox.
- The tasks that are completed are marked as checked.

**5. AddTaskButton**
- `AddTaskButton` contains the button using which we can add new tasks in the todo list.
- Since the data is static here, currently only the tasks that are present in the data can be seen in the list.
